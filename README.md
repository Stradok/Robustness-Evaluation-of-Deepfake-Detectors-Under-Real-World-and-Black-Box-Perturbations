Here is a clean, professional **README.md** you can directly use in your GitHub repository. I’ve written it to reflect exactly what your project does, what was left out (XAI), and the datasets used.

You can copy-paste this into a file named **`README.md`** in your project root.

## 📌 Project Title

**Robustness Evaluation of Deepfake Detectors Under Real-World and Black-Box Perturbations**

---

## 📖 Overview

Deepfake generation technologies have reached an advanced level of realism, making manipulated images and videos increasingly difficult to detect. This creates serious threats such as misinformation, identity fraud, and digital manipulation. While many deepfake detection models perform well on clean data, their reliability significantly decreases when they are subjected to realistic distortions or adversarial attacks.

This project introduces a **unified evaluation pipeline** to assess the robustness of deepfake detection models when exposed to **real-world perturbations** and **black-box adversarial attacks**. Instead of focusing only on clean data or white-box attacks, this work simulates the conditions that malicious actors might realistically use to evade detection systems in the real world.

The goal of this project is to evaluate how resistant popular deepfake detection models remain when subjected to such attacks.

---

## ✅ Models Evaluated

The following deepfake detection architectures were tested:

* **XceptionNet**
* **ResNet-50**
* **MesoNet**

These models were evaluated both on clean datasets and under various attack scenarios.

---

## ⚠️ Attack Types Implemented

### Real-World Perturbations

These simulate common distortions found in social media platforms and compressed media:

* Gaussian Noise
* Blur
* Contrast Reduction
* JPEG Compression (85, 60, 40, 20 quality levels)

### Black-Box Attacks

These do **not** require access to the internal parameters or gradients of the model and include:

* Random perturbations
* Noise-based manipulation
* Controlled pixel-level distortions

All generated adversarial images are stored for reproducibility and analysis.

---

## 📊 Quality & Performance Evaluation

For each attacked image, the following metrics were computed:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1-Score**
* **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
* **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**

All results are saved to a single consolidated CSV file generated by:

```
black_box_attacks.py
```

Plots are automatically generated by:

```
analysis.py
```

and saved inside the **`/plots`** directory.

---

## 📁 Datasets Used

The experiments were conducted on standard benchmark datasets for deepfake research:

* **FaceForensics++**

These datasets were selected to allow fair, consistent, and comparable evaluation of different detection architectures.

---

## 🚫 XAI Component (Not Included)

Originally, this project also aimed to include **Explainable AI (XAI)** methods such as Grad-CAM and saliency maps to analyze model decision-making.

However, due to **hardware and computational limitations**, this component was **removed** from the final implementation to ensure stable training and consistent evaluation of the detection and attack pipeline.

This decision was made to maintain experimental integrity and prevent incomplete or unstable results.

## 🔬 Key Findings

* **XceptionNet** performs best on clean data but is highly sensitive to JPEG compression and noise.
* **ResNet-50** shows relatively stable performance under most distortions.
* **MesoNet**, despite its smaller size, demonstrates the strongest resistance to black-box attacks.

This confirms that **high accuracy does not imply robustness**, and real-world testing is essential for evaluating deepfake detection reliability.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project provides a **realistic and reproducible evaluation framework** for testing the robustness of deepfake detection systems. It highlights significant weaknesses in current architectures and emphasizes the need for **robustness-based evaluation** rather than relying on accuracy alone.

Future work may include:

* Re-introduction of XAI with stronger computational resources
* Evaluation on video-based deepfakes
* Integration of defense mechanisms
